
# Customer Churn Prediction System (End-to-End ML + FastAPI + React)

Live Demo:  
- **Frontend (React UI):** https://churn-frontend-pgk3.onrender.com/  
- **Backend (FastAPI API):** https://churn-backend-7av6.onrender.com  

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a **production-style customer churn prediction system** built around the classic Telco Customer Churn dataset. It covers the full lifecycle:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Jupyter
- Feature engineering and model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
- SQLite-based data storage for raw + feature-processed customers
- A FastAPI backend providing a `POST /predict_churn` inference endpoint
- Logging all predictions to a `predictions` table
- A React dashboard with:
  - Live prediction UI
  - Prediction history table
  - Churn insights (charts by contract type and payment method)

The goal is to simulate a **real ML product**, not just a notebook.

🧪 Data & ML Pipeline
1. EDA (notebooks/01_eda.ipynb)

Inspected schema, missing values, distributions

Visualized:

Churn vs Non-Churn counts

Tenure, MonthlyCharges distributions

Churn rate by Contract type and Payment method

Documented key insights in Markdown cells

2. Feature Engineering (notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb)

Key steps:

Cleaned TotalCharges (string → numeric with median imputation for invalid entries)

Dropped customerID from model features (but kept it as an identifier elsewhere)

Encoded Churn as binary (Yes → 1, No → 0)

Created derived features:

tenure_group (0–6, 6–12, 12–24, 24–48, 48+ months)

total_services (count of subscribed services across multiple columns)

is_long_term (contracts that are not month-to-month)

One-hot encoded all categorical variables using pd.get_dummies

Saved final processed dataset to:

data/processed/processed_churn.csv

3. Modeling (notebooks/03_modeling.ipynb and src/train.py)

Split into train / test (80/20, stratified)

Standardized numeric features:

tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, total_services

Trained:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Evaluated each using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1

ROC-AUC

Selected the best model based on ROC-AUC

Saved an artifact dictionary to models/best_model.pkl:

{
  "model": best_model,
  "scaler": StandardScaler(),
  "feature_cols": [...],
  "numeric_cols": ["tenure", "MonthlyCharges", "TotalCharges", "total_services"]
}


This artifact is used directly by the FastAPI backend for consistent preprocessing.
🗄️ Database Design (SQLite)

All data is stored in churn.db at the project root.

Tables:

customers_raw

Direct import of Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

customers_features

Fully feature-engineered + one-hot encoded table, aligned with model features

predictions

Stores every API call:

id (auto)

customerID

churn_probability

risk_label (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

predicted_at (timestamp)

Database is created and populated via:

python src/data_prep.py

🌐 Backend: FastAPI Service

Entry point: src/api.py

Endpoints:

GET /

Health check.

Response:

{ "status": "ok", "message": "Churn prediction API is running" }

POST /predict_churn

Takes raw customer fields (similar to Telco dataset schema), performs:

Feature engineering (tenure_group, total_services, is_long_term)

One-hot encoding aligned with training

Scaling of numeric features using trained StandardScaler

Model inference → churn probability

Risk banding: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

Writes the prediction into predictions table in SQLite

  "customerID": "TEST-0001",
  "gender": "Female",
  "SeniorCitizen": 0,

  "items": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "customerID": "TEST-0001",
      "churn_probability": 0.87,
      "risk_label": "HIGH",
      "predicted_at": "2025-12-05 07:10:22"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

GET /stats/churn

Returns churn analytics computed from customers_raw:

Overall churn rate

Churn by contract type

Churn by payment method

Response (shape):

{
  "total_customers": 7043,
  "churn_rate_overall": 0.265,
  "churn_rate_by_contract": [
    { "contract": "Month-to-month", "churn_rate": 0.43 },
    { "contract": "One year", "churn_rate": 0.11 },
    { "contract": "Two year", "churn_rate": 0.03 }
  ],
  "churn_rate_by_payment_method": [
    { "payment_method": "Electronic check", "churn_rate": 0.45 },
    ...
  ]
}

Add more model monitoring: drift detection, calibration plots

Integrate a real relational database (PostgreSQL) instead of SQLite

Add A/B testing between multiple models

Implement a feature importance / explainability panel (SHAP)
